# Human-Centric Machine Learning seminar (Winter 2023)

The Human-Centric Machine Learning seminar course focuses on reading and presenting
recent research articles in human-centric machine learning, with a particular emphasis in
societal aspects of machine learning (fairness, accountability, transparency),
human-ai collaboration, strategic behavior and causality. The papers will cover
both theoretical foundations, applications as well as empirical studies.

The seminar course is open for Master students.
