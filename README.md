## Course work

As a student, you are expected to read and present one research paper in one of the topics of human-centric
machine learning and ask questions during the presentation of a different paper in the same topic by another
student. There are various topics available for you to choose from; you can find more information in the "Available Topics" 
section below. To help with your presentation, you will do a practice presentation in front of the instructions, where they
will give you feedback.

The presentations will be scheduled for 3-4 dates during the Winter semester. As a student, you are expected to attend all 
the presentations and actively engage in discussions.
